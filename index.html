            forward-thinking professional practice, and learn the skills required
            to be at the forefront of digital and creative economies. Using emerging

        <h3>FUTURE-READY GRADUATES</h3>
        <p>In 2016 Scotland IS (the organisation representing the IT sector in Scotland)
            estimated that the country would need at least 11,000 extra Information and
            Communications Technology (ICT) workers each year for the next five years â€“
            whilst there are only 2,000 ICT graduates per year from Scottish universities.
            Our range of courses address the skills-gap challenge facing the industry,
            and reflects the diversity of the modern computing landscape.</p>
        <p>We can support you to form your own venture, and develop innovative skills to expand
            your horizons beyond the taught curriculum. Recent students have launched their own
            businesses, undertaken commercial projects in parallel with their studies,
            published research papers at international conferences, and won national
            competitions. Our school has an excellent reputation for its innovative and
            practical approaches to teaching and learning. For generations it has produced
            qualified professionals across a broad spectrum of technical careers with
            graduates in high profile, international roles.</p>
